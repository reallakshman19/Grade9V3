# Engineering Relay V3.1 Handover

## Programme
- Outcome: Complete the remaining canonical-data, learner-page integration, and external-portability work while preserving delivered #162 and #173.
- Current goal: Prove Grade-9 Physics exit readiness and Grade-10 transition from canonical Grade-9 scope plus existing learner evidence, without a mastery percentage or second learner truth store.
- Roadmap revision: RM-V31-ISS169-EXIT-001
- Accepted progress: 12.2%

## Boundaries
- Allowed writes: ['Shared/tools/grade9_exit.py', 'tests/test_grade9_exit.py', 'docs/grade9/GRADE9-PHYSICS-EXIT-TRANSITION-REPORT.md', 'docs/architecture-manifest.json']
- Protected: ['Shared/tools/learner_evidence.py', 'Shared/library/**', 'Shared/publication_host/**', 'Physics/**', 'Learners/**', 'agents/relay/**']
- Prohibited: ['Do not persist mastery percentage, readiness probability, grade-state truth, or a second learner evidence store.', 'Do not write Physics canonical data or learner observations to make the report pass.', 'Do not treat transfer.dimension alone as changed-demand evidence; canonical CORE2B exposure plus transfer metadata is required.', 'Do not treat authored Core2B/transfer inventory as transition-requiredness without explicit transition authority.', 'Do not upgrade unresolved/external question refs into transfer evidence from caller prose.']

## Accepted checkpoint handoff
- Checkpoint: CP-G9EXIT-169-V31-001
- What changed: ['Added the Grade-9 exit/Grade-10 transition derived query and report on current main.', 'Corrected changed-demand classification to require canonical CORE2B exposure plus transfer metadata.', 'Separated changed-demand availability, independent observation and transition-requiredness.']
- What is true now: ['Known required/prerequisite gaps block; unknown required evidence remains evidence-required rather than failure.', 'Fragile required evidence produces targeted independent rechecks.', 'Authored changed-demand tasks without explicit transition requirement report AVAILABLE_UNOBSERVED and do not block Grade 10.', 'Accepted material head is f7f2c950f8f417a1b0ecbcc8234069130df4a344.']
- What remains uncertain: ['A future canonical transition authority may explicitly require changed-demand evidence; the report already supports that requirement without making current authored inventory authoritative.', 'Named misconception identity/severity remains unavailable in the observation contract.']
- Do not break: ['Do not persist a mastery/readiness score or second learner truth store.', 'Do not treat transfer.dimension without CORE2B exposure as changed demand.', 'Do not treat authored Core2B inventory as transition-requiredness by itself.', 'Do not modify Physics or Learners to satisfy a reporting concern.']
- Attempted and rejected: ['The PR 170 shortcut transfer.dimension => changed demand was rejected.', 'The PR 170 shortcut authored changed-demand inventory => mandatory witness was rejected.', 'Old V2.5/V3 acceptance from PR 170/181 was not imported.']
- Resume from: ['Run V3.1 PR_READY and MERGE authorization for PR 193.', 'If GitHub remains mergeable, merge PR 193, sync provider readback, close the task, reconcile WP-TA-105 COMPLETE and close Issue 169.']
- First successor action: Perform the separately authorized V3.1 delivery transition for PR 193 if provider and V3.1 merge gates remain green.

## Value added by this runner
- Capability added: []
- Capability strengthened: ['Added the Grade-9 exit/Grade-10 transition derived query and report on current main.', 'Corrected changed-demand classification to require canonical CORE2B exposure plus transfer metadata.', 'Separated changed-demand availability, independent observation and transition-requiredness.']
- Evidence added: ['focused_tests=PASS', 'spec_delivery=PASS', 'full_guardrails=PASS']
- Understanding improved: ['The original derived exit-view architecture remains valid after delivered Core projection changes.', 'Canonical CORE2B exposure plus transfer metadata is sufficient to classify changed-demand availability without persisting Core labels in learner observations.', 'Separating availability, observation and transition-requiredness removes the authored-inventory blocker shortcut without weakening explicit future transition requirements.']
- Downstream unlocked: ['Run V3.1 PR_READY and MERGE authorization for PR 193.', 'If GitHub remains mergeable, merge PR 193, sync provider readback, close the task, reconcile WP-TA-105 COMPLETE and close Issue 169.']
- Not improved: []
- Still not proved: ['The learner-observation schema does not encode named misconception identity/severity; the report does not invent it from generic error_stage.', 'Current Grade-9 scope authority contains no changed-demand-required field, so authored Core2B availability is descriptive unless future explicit transition authority declares a requirement.', 'PR 170 and PR 181 remain historical/candidate sources only and provide no live V3.1 acceptance credit.', 'A future canonical transition authority may explicitly require changed-demand evidence; the report already supports that requirement without making current authored inventory authoritative.', 'Named misconception identity/severity remains unavailable in the observation contract.']
- New questions: []

## Immediate next action
- Reconstruct the PR 170 derived-report implementation as bounded candidate material, correct the post-#173 demand-class and transition-requiredness shortcuts, then run focused falsifiers before repository-wide validation.
- Stop conditions: ['Any need to modify learner_evidence.py, Physics canonical data, or learner observations must be separately justified and scoped.', 'Do not import V2.5/V3 relay files or old acceptance from PR 170/181.', 'No merge without a fresh V3.1 checkpoint, CLEAR quality, GitHub mergeability, and explicit Owner delivery authority.']
